So I found this cool research paper on how all cell types can remember stuff.
I want to draw your attention to this bit.
"Our reporter system presents an opportunity to unravel the precise temporal relationships between the components of this complex, dynamic signaling network underlying learning and memory. An experimental throughput required to generate formal, mathematical models of cell signaling in memory formation is nearly impossible to attain using neural systems, including cultures of primary or iPSC-derived neurons. Our system, however, is infinitely scalable and could potentially be automated. This now enables us to pursue formalized molecular models of memory formation, with potential applications in cognitive enhancement and treatment of cognitive disabilities."
I want a research paper done with the future techniques described here and what I really want is a mathematical definition of this as a learning system. Im going to make an AI from it.

I understand you're interested in translating this biological memory system into a mathematical model that could potentially inform AI design. Let me help analyze what would be involved in such research.

This framework provides a starting point for developing an AI system based on cellular memory mechanisms. The key innovation here is the multiple timescale integration and state-dependent plasticity, which differs from traditional AI approaches.

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of this framework? I could expand on the mathematical formulations, experimental design, or AI implementation details.

One important caveat: while cellular memory systems offer fascinating insights, they may operate quite differently from neural networks. The challenge will be translating these molecular mechanisms into computational analogues while preserving their beneficial properties.
